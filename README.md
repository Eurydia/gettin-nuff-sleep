# Gettin-nuff-sleep
This programm just tells you whether you are getting enough sleep based on your age, the time go to bed, and the time you wake up.

This is the first thing you will see when you run the programm.
You can just ignore it of course since it doesn't mean anything.:wink:
```
#   Hello! How may I be of service?

        Do you think I'm getting enough sleep?

#   Well, of course!
```
Then the programm will ask the hour that you go to bed.
```
#   But, I need you to answer some questions.

#   (1/5)

#   What hour do you normally go to bed?

    I usually go to bed around (0 - 23) >> 22
```
Then the minute that you go to bed.
```
#   (2/5)

#   What minute do you normally go to bed?

    I usually go to bed around (0 - 59) >> 30
```
And, the hour and minute that you wake up respectively.
```
#   (3/5)

#   What hour do you normally get out of bed?

    I usually wake up around (00 - 23) >> 8
    
#   (4/5)

#   What minute do you normally get out of bed?

    I usually wake up around (0 - 59) >> 45
```
Lastly, it will ask for your age.
```
#   (5/5)

#   How old are you again?

    I'm >> 19
```
The output
```
#   For someone at the age of 19.

#   You should be getting between 8 and 10 hours of sleep.

#   Your sleep duration of 10 hour(s) and 15 minute(s) is a bit too much!

#   Please, trim it down a bit.
```
I'm getting 10 hours of sleep a night!?
